        <h2>Reasons for joining Altschool Africa</h2>
        <p>
            While I was in secondary school, I had deep interest and natural aptitiude for computer science and technology. I had a lot of things i wanted to try out but with time, I could not make progress because I did not have a roadmap. I knew something was missing; I needed a guideline or instructor then AltSchool Africa came my way. It met all the requirements I needed: flexibility, instructor, roadmap, networking etc. I knew this is a big opportunity so I joined. 
        </p>

        <h2>Plan to acheive with AltSchool Africa</h2>
        <p>
            After my diploma programme at AltSchool Africa, I will work in a company or startup so I get to understand the system. During those periods, I will continue learning about software engineering so I can get to the frontier of knowledge. After few years, probably 5 years of working and learning, I will be solving problems and building projects and innovations, any of them which sticks on wall, I will dive all and eventually build a startup then a company,
